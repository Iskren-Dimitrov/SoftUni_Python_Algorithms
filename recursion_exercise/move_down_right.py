'''Marinette has the ability to transform into Ladybug. She is stuck on a grid. Her initial location is at the\
top-left corner and tries to move to the bottom-right corner. However, she can only move either\
down or right at any point in time.
Write a program that prints the number of all possible unique paths that Marinette\
can take to reach the bottom-right corner.
